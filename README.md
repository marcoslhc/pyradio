## Requirements

* python 2.6+/3.2+
* mplayer or vlc installed and in your path


## Installation

The first thing is to make sure MPlayer and VLC are installed and are in the
PATH. To check this, go in your favorite terminal and make sure thiese programs
are launched when you type "mplayer" or "cvlc".

MacOSX tip: MPlayer is one of the available packages provided by
[Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew). But it is not the case of
VLC. Nevertheless, pyradio will also work with the binary of the application
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html). You simply can add a
symbolic link to the executable as follows (this link must of course be in your
PATH):

    ln -s /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC cvlc

The second step is to install the python package:

    pip install pyradio


## Shell

    $ pyradio -h

    usage: main.py [-h] [--stations STATIONS] [--random] [--add] [--list]

    Console radio player

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --stations STATIONS, -s STATIONS
                            Path on stations csv file.
    --random, -r          Start and play random station.
